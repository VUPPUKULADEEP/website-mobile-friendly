        <p>Iâ€™m Vuppu Kuladeep, a passionate and curious web development enthusiast.
            I enjoy learning new technologies and building responsive, user-friendly websites using HTML, CSS, and modern layout techniques like Flexbox and Grid.
            I believe in continuous learning and always look for opportunities to improve my skills and contribute to real-world projects. 
            This landing page is a part of my learning journey, where I explored semantic HTML, CSS responsiveness, and clean layout design.</p>
